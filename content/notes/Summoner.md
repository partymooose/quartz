Gain when group is heavy in 15s buffs and you can clip Slipstream under the buff window. Otherwise, use Titan opener below.

# Gear sets

All builds are viable and competitive with each other. Crit builds are better in full uptime scenarios and better at aligning with buffs, but the speed SMN playstyle is still a viable option if you prefer it.

# Optimization

## General Tips
> - For all fights: **Use Demis on CD, do not delay them, even if this puts you out of sync with party buffs - yes, even your own.**
> - For all situations with downtime, condense primals by generally cutting abilities in this order:
>	- R3 < EmRite < Ifrit Melee = RRite = R4 (depends on timing)

## Abyssos
### P5S
> - Use demis on CD, hold SL for after Devour
> - Using Ifrit 3rd during Ruby Glow 1 will have Crimson Cyclone available while poison puddles are still out - be cautious of this if the pattern provides the smaller safe spot, as using it during this will most likely put you in the poison. Shift Ruin III + IV before CC to adjust without loss.
> - For buff windows after Devour, try to align Titan into buff windows.
> - If killtime allows, delay ED for buff windows. 

### P6S
> Full uptime, use all on CD. Can pot at 2/8 for 4 Festers, if you kill before 8 use standard 0/6.

### P7S
> - Hold SL at 2min window before second Immortal's Obol
> - Immortal's Obol forces a 1 GCD loss, make sure to take this into account for Demi timing
> - For slower killtimes (near enrage), 0/5/10 pot timing is optimal with 5 min being used during Phoenix window. If you will not gain a third use, 0/6 as standard.

### P8S I
> If snake phase first -> use phoenix before the second leg phase (downtime) and condense primals after the downtime at enrage. Pot at 0/6 mins.

### P8S II
> Drop R3 leading into HC1. Drop R3 and 3 Emerald Rites leading into HC2. Use phoenix and Energy Drain immediately after High Concept 2. By using both on CD, you will gain an extra use before enrage. Use Searing where your group is using buffs. 

## Asphodelos
### P1S
> Standard 100% uptime. Place pet center for both Intemperances so Searing Light will reach everyone, don’t run out too quickly or you’ll miss buffs. Nothing else to mention here!

### P2S
> 1st GCD Bahamut opener, pot at 2:00 for 4 festers, 2nd pot around 6:30 window. Use Bahamut/Phoenix on cooldown. Save Searing Light for after Kampeos Harma.

### P3S 
> - Pot at 2:00 for 4 festers, + condensed all 3 primals (~2 GCDs per primal, summoning the next one as soon as it's available) before add phase. 2nd pot at Fountain of fire. 
> - With 2nd GCD Bahamut opener, use Phoenix on time. With 1st GCD, delay Phoenix by 1 GCD. Do not delay more than this. Revelation can cleave 1st vulnerable fire if timed late in 5th GCD of Phoenix. Brand  of purgatory as your last GCD of Phoenix to hit 3+ targets if they are still alive.
> - 2:00 window, delay all festers to hit in raid buffs at no cost. Rush 3 primals: garuda -> Titan -> Ifrit.
> - Add phase: use Phoenix wave 1, primals wave 2.
> - Reopener, pot not recommended here because of earlier pot timing. Pot at fountain of fire or post tornados.

### P4S I
> 100% uptime, standard rotation is optimal. Delay Searing Light at 2:00 if group is delaying. Otherwise, use everything on cooldown.

### P4S II
> 100% uptime. Delay Searing Light at Act 2 and Act 4 by 1 GCD and place pet center so Searing Light hits everyone.
