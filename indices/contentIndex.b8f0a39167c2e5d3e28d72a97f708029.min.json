Three rings will cover the floor, and magic circles containing either triangles or rectangles will appear at every clock position around the outer edge of the arena. Triangles will correspond to a conal AoE originating from the magic circle and rectangles will correspond to a half-room cleave originating from the magic circle, similar to Exoterikos from EX1.\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_triangle.png\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_rectangle.png\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n\u003e To know which AoEs are being activated, you will need to trace the blue line maze from the center to the outer edge and see which magic circle that it connects to. As an added complication, the boss will rotate one or more of the circles containing lines 1/8th turn clockwise or counterclockwise, as indicated by the curved arrows that appear on the circles. One major change from the Normal version is that if the outer ring rotates, so do the AoEs, so keep that in mind.\n\u003e While this mechanic does happen in multiple different patterns throughout the fight, each instance has some things that are always true that make it easier to resolve each time.\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_purgations.png\" width=\"60%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n### 1st Pattern\n\n\u003e This will always be only one shape, and the inner and outer circles will always be rotating. Solve the pattern based on where the lines and AoEs will end up and stand in the safe area for that shape - since it's only ever one, there's slightly more time to solve this.\n\n### 2nd Pattern\n\n\u003e This will always be two shapes at a 90-degree angle from each other, and the outer circle is always rotating. So far, I've only seen this to end up as 2 rectangles, making the safe spot always directly opposite the \"elbow\" of the V shape made by the lines in the inner circle. In the even it's two triangles, however, the safe spot is simply between the two active triangles.\n\n### 3rd Pattern\n\n\u003e All shapes are triangles, and there are always two activated. They will either be directly adjacent to each other, or 90-degrees separated like the second pattern, depending on whether the center circle ends up connecting to a squiggly line or not - only the middle ring is rotating. For all patterns, you only have to solve for one triangle as directly next to either active triangle is always safe.\n\n### 4th Pattern\n\n\u003e This is always all rectangles, and there are always two activated. One rectangle will always be at a 45-degree angle to the other, making the safe spot always resolve as a single 1/8th \"pizza slice\". Only the middle ring will rotate.\n\n### 5th Pattern\n\n\u003e Only one shape is active, and both the inner and middle circles are rotating opposite each other. No trick here, just solve the pattern based on rotations.\n\n### 6th Pattern\n\n\u003e Two shapes will activate, always one triangle and one rectangle directly adjacent. Only the middle circle will rotate. The safe spot for this is always a small triangle on the same side of the arena as the active triangle, across from the fire.\n\n## Arch Inferno\n\n\u003e Initial safe spots will always be on intercards. Group 1 goes north, Group 2 goes south. The AoEs around the edge will start moving, forcing you to rotate around the boss constantly for the duration of the mechanic. While these AoEs are moving, 2 of 3 additional mechanics will happen at random. Immediately after the first random mechanic, a line AoE will appear through the boss, just dodge the danger bacon. Immediately after the final circle AoE explodes, there will be a conal cleave from the boss on each player (Radial Flagration is  the cast), so get into your clock spots.\n\n### Random Mechanics {.center}\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_arch_spread.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_arch_stack.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_arch_enumeration.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n\u003e 2 of these mechanics will happen at random during Arch Inferno, they're fairly self explanatory:\n\u003e\n\u003e - Spread: puddles will drop around you, simply spread out in the safe area DPS right/Support left, with Healers/Ranged taking their spreads further out to allow for uptime.\n\u003e - Stack Markers: groups will stack on healers in their respective sides of the boss\n\u003e - Enumerations: 2-person stacks, Tanks/Melee will stack close to the boss while Healers/Ranged will stack further back\n\n## Adds Phase\n\n\u003e 6 adds will spawn, 5 small ones and one large one. The large add in center will repeatedly cast raidwides with a stacking fire vuln debuff, so focus it down first. The small add directly north will repeatedly cast random small circle AoEs to dodge on the ground, so take it out second. From there, you can pretty much just go clockwise.\n\u003e\n\u003e The two northeast/northwest adds will put out orange tethers that end in a small AoE tankbuster to whoever they're tethered to - tanks should take the tethers and move away from the party.\n\u003e\n\u003e The two southeast/southwest adds will make a purple tether to a random player that ends in a conal cleave from the add - tethered players should point these south outside the arena to avoid cleaving the party.\n\u003e\n\u003e Immediately after killing all the adds, Rubicante will become targetable again and begin casting a massive raidwide. Heal, shield, and mitigate, and prepare for phase 2.\n\n## Flamerake\n\n\u003e This mechanic combines a cross-shaped exaflare AoE with debuffs that will result in AoEs once their timers end. Each player will get up to 2 debuffs that resolve at different times. 4 players will get a flare (triangle shaped debuff), 1 player will get a stack (X shaped/stack marker debuff), and all 8 players will get a spread puddle (circle shaped). To resolve:\n\u003e - Preposition in clock spots and wait for the spinning cross to stop. This will either be pointed in a + shape and hit cardinals, or an X shape and hit intercardinals. If it is hitting your clock spot, rotate clockwise into the safe area.\n\u003e - After the first hit, the safe spots will be in a # shape. If you have a flare debuff, take your flare to the outer edge of the arena in the safe zone to explode. If you have a stack debuff or only one debuff, stack in the center.\n\u003e - After the second hit, the safe spot will be only in the center of the arena. Puddles will explode at this time, so stay spread in roughly your clock position at max melee.\n\n### Cardinals {.center}\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_1.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_2.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_3.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n### Intercardinals {.center}\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_cross_1.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_cross_2.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_cross_3.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n\u003e The flare/stack is also role based, so it will either be DPS in/Support out, or Support in/DPS out.\n\n### Inferno {.center}\n\n\u003e While Rubicante is cosplaying as Sephiroth, Inferno is a spread mechanic that leaves a bleed debuff, NOT a raidwide. Immediately after resolving Flamerake, just stand in your clockspots and heal up.\n\n## Scalding Ring/Signal\n\n\u003e The mechanic changes based on the castbar name. Scalding Ring will be a donut AoE, and Scalding Signal will be point-blank. At the same time, line AoEs will go out to each player, so to resolve, stand in your clockspots.\n\n### Sweeping Immolation {.center}\n\n\u003e The boss will turn and cleave half the arena in front of him. He will also perform two secondary mechanics at the same time - the clones that spawned at the outside of the arena after the previous line AoEs will do a second dash through (if clockspots were done correctly previously, you can use the lines on the floor), and there will either be a stack or spread based on the pattern on his wing. If there is one large flower, stack in one of the safe slices. If there are multiple flowers, spread based on the pattern below:\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_sweeping_spread.png\" width=\"60%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n###  Dualfire {.center}\n\n\u003e Simple 100-degree conal tankbuster on both tanks. Tanks will take these NE/NW and mit while party stacks south.\n\n## Flamespire Claw (Everyone will call this Limit Cut but they're wrong)\n\n\u003e Players will receive a number marker on their head from 1 through 8, indicating the order in which they will receive a large conal cleave. While these cleaves are happening, there are 2 persistent grabbable tethers coming from the boss that will give a stacking Flamespire debuff. If you reach 5 stacks, the party will wipe. If you get hit by a cleave while having any debuff stacks, you will die.\n\u003e\n\u003e To resolve, the players getting cleaved will wait NW for odd numbers, NE for even numbers, starting with 1 and 2. Players with 7 and 8 will begin taking the tethers.\n\u003e\n\u003e After each player is hit by a cleave, they will move down and grab the tether from the previous players, so the tether order will go 7/8 -\u003e 1/2 -\u003e 3/4 -\u003e 5/6. If you are next in line to be hit, move to the NE/NW spot to take the hit.\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamespire_1.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamespire_2.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamespire_3.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n\u003e To make the tether acquisition easier, 7 and 8 should start as close to the boss as possible. Odd number players with the tether should bias slightly West, and even number players should bias slightly east, to make it easier for players taking the tethers to know who to take it from.\n\u003e\n\u003e Immediately after Flamespire Claw, there will be another spread-form Inferno.

Shift Ruin III + IV before CC to adjust without loss.\n\u003e - For buff windows after Devour, try to align Titan into buff windows.\n\u003e - If killtime allows, delay ED for buff windows. \n\n### P6S\n\u003e Full uptime, use all on CD. Can pot at 2/8 for 4 Festers, if you kill before 8 use standard 0/6.\n\n### P7S\n\u003e - Hold SL at 2min window before second Immortal's Obol\n\u003e - Immortal's Obol forces a 1 GCD loss, make sure to take this into account for Demi timing\n\u003e - For slower killtimes (near enrage), 0/5/10 pot timing is optimal with 5 min being used during Phoenix window. If you will not gain a third use, 0/6 as standard.\n\n### P8S I\n\u003e If snake phase first -\u003e use phoenix before the second leg phase (downtime) and condense primals after the downtime at enrage. Pot at 0/6 mins.\n\n### P8S II\n\u003e Drop R3 leading into HC1. Drop R3 and 3 Emerald Rites leading into HC2. Use phoenix and Energy Drain immediately after High Concept 2. By using both on CD, you will gain an extra use before enrage. Use Searing where your group is using buffs. \n\n## Asphodelos\n### P1S\n\u003e Standard 100% uptime. Place pet center for both Intemperances so Searing Light will reach everyone, don’t run out too quickly or you’ll miss buffs. Nothing else to mention here!\n\n### P2S\n\u003e 1st GCD Bahamut opener, pot at 2:00 for 4 festers, 2nd pot around 6:30 window. Use Bahamut/Phoenix on cooldown. Save Searing Light for after Kampeos Harma.\n\n### P3S \n\u003e - Pot at 2:00 for 4 festers, + condensed all 3 primals (~2 GCDs per primal, summoning the next one as soon as it's available) before add phase. 2nd pot at Fountain of fire. \n\u003e - With 2nd GCD Bahamut opener, use Phoenix on time. With 1st GCD, delay Phoenix by 1 GCD. Do not delay more than this. Revelation can cleave 1st vulnerable fire if timed late in 5th GCD of Phoenix. Brand  of purgatory as your last GCD of Phoenix to hit 3+ targets if they are still alive.\n\u003e - 2:00 window, delay all festers to hit in raid buffs at no cost. Rush 3 primals: garuda -\u003e Titan -\u003e Ifrit.\n\u003e - Add phase: use Phoenix wave 1, primals wave 2.\n\u003e - Reopener, pot not recommended here because of earlier pot timing. Pot at fountain of fire or post tornados.\n\n### P4S I\n\u003e 100% uptime, standard rotation is optimal. Delay Searing Light at 2:00 if group is delaying. Otherwise, use everything on cooldown.\n\n### P4S II\n\u003e 100% uptime. Delay Searing Light at Act 2 and Act 4 by 1 GCD and place pet center so Searing Light hits everyone.\n\n## Links\n- [SMN Gear Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v4qZAPwzANTt4sOqkwi75apbjiNPXlNjYtA5NlW6uhM/edit#gid=635680971)","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T15:10:20.780859371Z","tags":null},"/notes/Tank-Resources":{"title":"Tank Resources","content":"## Jobs\n- [Dark Knight](notes/Dark%20Knight)\n- [Gunbreaker](notes/Gunbreaker)\n- [Paladin](notes/Paladin)\n- [Warrior](notes/Warrior)\n\n## General Resources","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T15:10:20.780859371Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-Epic-of-Alexander-Ultimate":{"title":"The Epic of Alexander Ultimate","content":"---\n# Encounter Info\n## Drops\n**Chest One** | **Chest Two** | **Guaranteed**","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T15:10:20.780859371Z","tags":null},"/notes/Ultima-Weapon-Ultimate":{"title":"Ultima Weapon Ultimate","content":"---\n## Encounter Info\n### Drops\n**Chest One** | **Chest Two** | **Guaranteed**","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T15:10:20.780859371Z","tags":null},"/notes/Ultimate":{"title":"Ultimate","content":"## Fights in tier:\n\n- [Ultima Weapon Ultimate](notes/Ultima%20Weapon%20Ultimate)\n- [Ultimate Coils of Bahamut](notes/Ultimate%20Coils%20of%20Bahamut)\n- [The Epic of Alexander Ultimate](notes/The%20Epic%20of%20Alexander%20Ultimate)\n- [Dragonsong War Ultimate](notes/Dragonsong%20War%20Ultimate)\n\n## General Tier Info","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T15:10:20.780859371Z","tags":null},"/notes/Ultimate-Coils-of-Bahamut":{"title":"Ultimate Coils of Bahamut","content":"---\n## Encounter Info\n### Drops\n**Chest One** | **Chest Two** | **Guaranteed**","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T15:10:20.780859371Z","tags":null},"/notes/Warrior":{"title":"Warrior","content":"## Openers\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/war_opener.png\" width=\"60%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n## Gear sets\n\n\n\n## Links","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T15:10:20.780859371Z","tags":null},"/notes/White-Mage":{"title":"White Mage","content":"# Gear Sets\n\n## Pre-Raid BiS\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003ciframe \n\t\twidth=\"90.75%\" \n\t\theight=\"1000\" \n\t\tsrc=\"https://etro.gg/embed/gearset/fd3cef15-74c2-43c3-b8b0-47fa581e5f7a\" \n\t\ttitle=\"\" \n\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n## Savage BiS Options\n### 2.44 Mid-Piety\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003ciframe \n\t\twidth=\"90.75%\" \n\t\theight=\"1000\" \n\t\tsrc=\"https://etro.gg/embed/gearset/e2fc82de-9629-48fd-ad46-5b13be00aaba\" \n\t\ttitle=\"\" \n\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n### 2.42 Low-Piety\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003ciframe \n\t\twidth=\"90.75%\" \n\t\theight=\"1000\" \n\t\tsrc=\"https://etro.gg/embed/gearset/a7cb866f-6a5f-4744-b682-dddba4339143\" \n\t\ttitle=\"\" \n\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T15:10:20.780859371Z","tags":null}}
